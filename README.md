usage:

```bash
# generate deployment
spiff merge 1-infrastructure-template.yml > infrastructure.yml

# generate cloudformation template
go run *.go infrastructure.yml > cloudformation.json
```

and then deploy that cloudformation via the console

visualizing the infrastructure:

```bash
cat cloudformation.json | ./cfviz | dot -Tpng -o drone.png
```

you'll probably want to delete your stack after; this costs ~$100/mo.
